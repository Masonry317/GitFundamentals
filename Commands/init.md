# git init
The `git init` command is used to creat an emepty git respository.

If you wanted to create a new direectory and initialize a git respository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Once inside a git respository, you can start using commands such as [status](./status.md),
[add](./add.md),
[commit](./Commit.md),
[push](./push.md)
and more.

Init will create the respository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
