# git pull

similar to a [gitpush](./PUSH.md), a `git pull` will interact  with a remote repository.
Only this this  it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local repository.
this means any commits made that are on the remote repository 

this can be done by adding the remote name and branch name:
```
git pull origin main
```

if tthere is any upstream connection established, you can use `git pull` without specifying a remote branch
